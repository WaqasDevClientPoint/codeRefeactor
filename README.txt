=====What's Good About It==========

Comments: I saw code commenting is done some parts that helps other developer's and even you after some period of time what did i wrote here

Use of Constants: Constants like SUPERADMIN_ROLE_ID and env('SUPERADMIN_ROLE_ID') are used for readability, making it easier to understand the code.

Eloquent ORM: Eloquent, Laravel's ORM, is used in parts of the code to interact with the database, which provides a more expressive and readable syntax compared to raw SQL.

Separation of Concerns (Repository): The code attempts to separate database interactions into a repository, which is a good practice for maintainability and scalability.


======What Could Be Better=========

Separation of Concerns: I always preffer to keep business logic seperate from controller for example: 
The controller appears to contain business logic related to user roles ($cuser->user_type) and filtering. This logic should be moved to a service layer or dedicated middleware to keep the controller focused on request handling.

Validation (Controller): I noticed there were some function in controller that don't have validation implemented like store, update etc.I think its very important to implemlement validation to insure user cannot add unwanted data into ous system

Pagination (Controller): I think custom approach is used to handle pagination instead of Laravel's built-in pagination methods. Using Laravel's pagination methods would make the code more consistent and maintainable.

Error Handling (Repository): The way errors are dealt with in the repository is not very good. We should handle errors better and explain them clearly. We should also keep a record of errors for future reference.

Business Logic (Repository): The repository does some business-related work, like calculating dates and updating job status. This work should ideally be done in a different part of the code to keep things organized.

Database Updates (Repository): When we change information in the database, we use different methods. It's better to use the same method every time to make it easier to read and maintain.

Use of Carbon: We use the Carbon library for working with dates and times, which is a good practice. But we should use it consistently throughout the code.

Comments (Repository): There are no comments in the repository code to explain what's going on. Adding comments to explain complicated parts of the code is important for keeping it understandable.

Error Handling (Controller): The controller code doesn't handle errors very well. We need to handle errors better and give the right messages when things go wrong.

Code Duplication (Controller): Some parts of the code in the controller are repeated. We should clean this up and make the code easier to read and work with by using helper methods.
